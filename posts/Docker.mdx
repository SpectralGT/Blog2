# What and Why of Docker ?

- Virtualization software
- Makes developing and deploying applications much easier
- Packages application with all the necessary dependencies, configuration, system tools and runtimes
- Portable artifact, easily shared and distributed


| Development before containers                                                                 | Development after containers                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <ul><li>Each developer needs to install and configure all services directly on their OS</li><li>Installation process different for each OS environment</li><li>Many steps where something can go wrong</li></ul> | <ul><li>Own isolated environment</li><li>Postgres packaged with all dependencies and configs</li><li>Start service as a Docker container using 1 Docker command</li><li>Command same for all services</li><li>Standardized process for running any service on any local dev environment</li><li>Easy to run different versions of the same app without conflicts</li></ul> |







| Deployment before Containers                                      | Deployment after Containers                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <ul><li>Installations and configurations done directly on the server's OS</li><li>Dependency version conflicts</li> <li>Human errors can happen</li> <li>Back and forth communications </li> </ul> | <ul><li>Instead of textual, everything is packaged inside the Docker artifact</li><li>No configurations needed on the server (except Docker runtime)</li><li>Less room for errors</li><li>Install Docker runtime on the server</li><li>Run Docker command to fetch and run the Docker artifacts</li></ul> |



# Docker vs Virtual Machine

- An OS is made up of 2 layers i.e. OS Kernel and OS Application Layer
- Kernel is at the core of every OS
- Kernel interacts between hardware and software components
- Docker contains the OS application layer
- Services and apps are installed on top of that layer
- VMs contains both OS application layer and OS kernel layer
- Docker images are much smaller (Docker images are in MD while VM images in GB)
- Containers take seconds to start while VMs take minutes to start
- Docker is compatible only with Linux distros while VMs are compatible with all OS
- Docker was originally made for Linux
- However, Docker Desktop allows you to run Linux containers on Windows or MacOS
- Docker Desktop uses a Hypervisor layer with a lightweight Linux distro

# Install Docker Locally

- Got to the official Docker website
- Follow installation steps

## Docker Desktop includes

- Docker Engine
  - A server with a long-running daemon process "Dockerd"
  - Manages images and containers
- Docker CLI - Client
  - CLI to interact with Docker Server
  - Execute Docker commands to start/stop... containers
- GUI Client
  - To manages your containers and images with a GUI

# Images vs Containers

| Images | Docker Container |
|---|---|
| <ul><li>An executable application artifact</li><li>Includes app source code, but also complete environment configuration</li><li>Add environment variables, create directories, files, etc.</li><li>Immutable template that defines how a container will be realized</li><li>You can run multiple containers from 1 image</li></ul> | <ul><li>Actually starts the application</li><li>A running instance of an image</li><li>That's when the container environment is created</li></ul> |

# Public and Private Registries

| Public Docker Registries | Private Docker Registries |
|---|---|
| <ul><li>Dockerhub largest public registry</li><li>Anyone can search and download docker images</li></ul> | <ul><li>You need to authenticate before accessing the registry</li><li>All big cloud provider offer private registries: Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry, ect.</li><li>Nexus (popular artifact repository manager)</li><li>Docker Hub</li></ul> |



# Registry vs Repository

## Docker Registry

- A service providing storage
- Collection of repositories

## Docker Repository

- Collection of related images with same name but different versions


# Docker Registries

- A storage and distribution system for Docker images
- Official images available form applications like Redis, Mongo,etc.
- Official images are maintained by the software authors or in collaboration with Docker community
- Docker hosts one of the biggest Docker Registry, called 'Docker Hub'

# Image Versioning

- Docker images are versioned
- Different versions are identified by tags


# Main Docker commands

```bash
docker images #List all docker images
```

```bash
docker ps #List all running containers
```

```bash
#Pull an image from a registry
docker pull {name}:{tag}

docker pull nginx:1.23
#or
docker pull nginx:latest
```

- To create a container with random name from given image(either local or in dockerhub) and starts it
```bash
docker run {name}:{tag}

docker run nginx:1.23
```

Run container in background and prints the container ID using `-d` or `--detach`

```bash
docker run -d nginx:1.23
```

To view logs from service running inside the container (which are present at the time of execution) use :

```bash
docker logs {container}
docker logs 1e342f2
```

To stop a container

```bash
docker stop {container}
docker stop 1e342f2
```

# Run Containers

- docker run command Creates a new container
- Doesn't re-use previous container
- use `-a` pr `--all` to List all container (stopped and running)

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- to stop a container :

```bash
docker stop {container}
```

- to give name to a container when creating a new container, use:

```bash
docker run --name {name} {name}:{tag}

docker run --name web-app nginx:1.23
```

- to stare one or more stopped containers, use:

```bash
docker start {container}
```

# Port Binding

- Application inside container runs in an isolated Docker network
- This allows us to run the same app running on the same port multiple times
- We need to expose the container port to the host (the machine the container runs on)
- use `-p` or `--publish` to publish a container's port to the host

```bash
docker run -d -p {HOST_PORT}:{CONTAINER_PORT} {name}:{tag}

docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23
```

# Create own Image (Dockerfile)

- Dockerfile is text document that contains commands to assemble an image
- Docker can then build an image by reading those instruction

## Structure of Dockerfile

- **Dockerfile** start from a parent image or **base image**
- You choose the base image, depending on which tool you need to have available, for example node, tomcat, python,etc.
- Dockerfile must begin with a `FROM` instruction
- Build this image from the specified image
- RUN command will execute any command in a shell inside the container environment
- `COPY` command copies files or directories from \<src\> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path \<dest\>
```
COPY {src} {dest}
```
- While `RUN` is executed on container, `COPY` is execute on host
- `WORKDIR` sets the working directory for all following commands
- Like changing into a directory using `cd`
- `CMD` command is for the instruction that is to be execute when a Docker container starts
- There can only be one `CMD` command in a dockerfile.

## Example

- Let our node.js project file structure be

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── server.js
│   └── Dockerfile
└── package.json

```

- Then our Dockerfile will be :

```
FROM node:19-alpine

COPY package.json /app/
COPY src /app/

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install

CMD ["node","server.js"]
```

## Building the image

- To build the image use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t {name}

docker build -t node-app
```

- The `-t` or `--tag` is used to set a name and optionally a tag in the "name:tag" format
